## Git is a DVCS. 




##Version control system (VCS)
 - Version control allows you to revert a file or project to a previous version.
 - tracks modifications and who modifies
 - compares changes
 - mistakes with files can be fixed
 
### Types of Version Controls
 CVCS: Centralized Version Control System
  - Developer team collaboration on a single file or file set
  - Allows one server to store all changes and file versions
  - Eliminates the need to use all local databases
 
 DVCS: Distributed Version Control
  - Allows clients to make repository copies
  - Useful if CVCS server goes down
  - Can be placed back onto server to replace lost info
