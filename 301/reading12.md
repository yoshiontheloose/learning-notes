SQL | NoSQL
| :---: | :---: |
| Relational Databases (RDBMS) | Non-Relational Database (or distributed) |
Table based (rows and columns) | Document based (key/value pairs, graphs or columns)
Predefined Schema | Dynamic Schema
Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable
Not a good fit for hierarchical data storage | Best suited for hierarchical data storage

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

Data in the form of tables  

**Give a real world example.**

High transaction/transaction oriented apps

**What does SQL stand for?**

SQL - Structured Query Language

**What is a relational database?**

A database that supports the structured query language

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

Tables! A storage container

**What is a ‘schema’?**

Schema is the organizational structure of databases. Schemas are what can go into a table, defined by the fields in the table

Cannot have more fields than defined for the table, all records have to follow the schema

**What is a NoSQL database?**

Built to store A LOT of data

MongoDB - most popular NoSQL database

**How does it work?**

Works with collections rather than tables. Collections have multiple documents with different fields.
Less relation merging happening.

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

Data stored as documents in collections

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

SQL, it has horizontal scaling.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

Doesn't have the ability to frequently change data.  
Vertical scaling has limits.
