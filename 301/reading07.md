## How I explained REST to my brother

Source (https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

Some smart guy who helped write the first web servers.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

They are missing the protocol context

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

It describes "the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world."

The protocol points to REST (Representational state transfer), which gives a resource.

HTTP is "a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns."

**What does a GET do?**

Browsers use it to "get" things.

**What does a POST do?**

Allows one system to add something to another.

**What does PUT do?**

Allows one system to replace something in another.

**What does PATCH do?**

Like "PUT," but partially updates.
