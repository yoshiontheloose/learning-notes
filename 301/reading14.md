## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

**What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?**

In the mid 80's personal computers were becoming a household item and marketed as more of a male toy/tool.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

(Honestly, the way this question is worded comes off weird, especially with the subject matter being diversity and inclusion.)
It shouldn't have mattered, however, the marketing as mentioned above gave males an advantage through the "computers are for boys" narrative leaving girls less likely to acquire similar experience.

I'd also say the narrative went on through time in different negatively impactful ways as girls especially were made fun of for playing video games in the early 90s.

**What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**

Some of the big companies like Microsoft and Google could do better on their female to male ratios.

Amazon has the highest number of "other." As an indigenous american often classified under that category, in a way it's positive to see as they are a company I am interested in working for.

Some companies hire more ethnicities, but the same ones don't seem to hire as many women.

**When are diversity efforts most successful?**

When company leaders understand the importance of diversity and commit to inclusion efforts because it's the right thing to do.

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**

Diverse teams of people introduce different ways of seeing problems and brainstorming solutions.

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

The article gave an example of YouTube's team of mostly right handed devs making the app and left-handed users uploading videos upside down due to how they use it.
