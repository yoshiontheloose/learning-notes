##Paths 
  - 2 types: Absolute and relative
  - refer to a file or directory
  - system directs to same location with either path when we refer file or directory
  
 **Root directory** -noted with one forward slash (/)
  - mother of subdirectories
  - files can live here (sub or root)
  
  -Absolute paths- location in relation to the root directory. **Always** begin with a forward slash (/)
  -Relative paths- location related to where we currently are in the file system. No slash. 
  
 shortcut | For | Example
 ------- | ------- | -------
 ~ | shortcut for home directory | ~/Documents
 . | current directory | ./Documents
 .. | parent directory | can use many times, listing of root directory
 
 
# Files 
***Everything is a file***

File Extension: 2-4 characters at the end of the file indicating file type (.exe, .gif, .jpg, etc)

Treat things like they are all case sensitive

Anything inside quotes is considered a single item "" or \`\`

Hidden files
  - create or rename file with a dot (.) to hide files 
  - remove . to unhide
  - command "ls" will not show hidden files and directories
    * To see hidden files use ls space \-a   "ls \-a"
    * ls \-a will show directory AND hidden files
