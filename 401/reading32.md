### React - Conditional Rendering

[Source](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

Conditional rendering in React is when you create components with specific behaviors and render the ones you need, depending on the state of the app. It is akin to JavaScript conditions as it uses the `if` operator or `conditional operator` to create elements that represent the current state then React update the UI.

Variables are used to store elements. Part of a component can be rendered without changing the rest of the output. An example would be login and logout components for buttons.

Use curly braces to embed expressions in JSX, this is useful for including conditional elements.

JavaScript conditonal operator `condition ? true : false` can also be used to conditionally render elements inline.

Always extract a component when a condition becomes complex.

If a component is rendered by another and you want to hide it, return null instead of it's render output. Lifecycle methods of the component will still be called.
