(NOTE: Since this demo was published `scikit-learn` has been updated. The `train_test_split` function is now imported from `sklearn.model_selection`)

`variable.fit()` - fits a linear model

`variable.predict()` - Predict "Y" using the linear model

`variable.score()` - measures observed outcomes

"Regression analysis explores the relationship between a quantitative _response variable_ and one or more _explanatory variables_."

**Simple Linear Regression** - one explanatory variable

**Multiple Regression** - multiple explanatory variables

When using one variable to predict the other 



Regression line - used for prediction

- always passes through the point mean of x and mean of y

Residual = observed value - predicted value

- every observation has an associated residual

- vertical distances of data from the regression line

  - above line = positve
  - below line = negative
