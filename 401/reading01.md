## Pain and Suffering

[Source](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

**As you work through feeling the pain of growth over the next 10 weeks, consider heavily the story that you attach to it.**

***What’s your perspective?***

***Why are you doing this? -Ask this without existential dread.***

***Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?***

***Are you doing this for you?***

Ask questions that bridge the gap between what you know and what you need to be able to do.

Research!

Build your resources and your community!

Don’t experience the pain in silence—that slides toward needless pain and the realm of suffering.

You’re here because you chose to invest in a different life. A better life.

You are building your value.

[Source](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)

### Big O Notation

- Describes the complexity of an algorithm as well as memory/disk space and execution time

- Worst-case scenario

### O(1)

- Algorithm which is always executed in the same time no matter the input data size

### O(N)

- "Algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set."

### O(N0²)

- "Algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set."

### O(2^N)

- "Algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set"

### Logarithms O(log N)
