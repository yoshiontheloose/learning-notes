# Growth Mindset 

The ability to take oneself out of a comfort zone to learn something new while perservering through new challenges towards growth.
 
## Keeping the Growth Mindset
 
 * _climb the wall of distractions_  
 * _ask questions or research when met with an obstacle_
 * _take a step back when needed then re-engage_

### Food for Positivity
Everyone is on their own journey, learning at their own pace. 

**Always** submit something rather than have late assignments that are perfect. You can edit later!
