# Growth Mindset

The ability to take oneself out of a comfort zone to learn something new while perservering through new challenges towards growth.

## Keeping the Growth Mindset

* _climb the wall of distractions_  
* _ask questions or research when met with an obstacle_
* _take a step back when needed then re-engage_
  
### Food for Positivity

Everyone is on their own journey, learning at their own pace.

**Always** submit something rather than have late assignments that are perfect. You can edit later!

**_Beware the CSS sinkhole of time_**
