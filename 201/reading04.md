**Navigator** - Editor. Does not write the code.

Four basic yet important skills developers utilize:

- Speaking - Explain what the code does with correct terminology
- Reading - Read code written by others
- Writing - Write code

### Why Pair Programming? 

- _Greater Efficiency_
- _Engaged Collaboration_
- _Learning From Fellow Students_
- _Social Skills_
- _Job Interview preparation_
- _Work Environment preparation_

Both teammates can learn from each other!
