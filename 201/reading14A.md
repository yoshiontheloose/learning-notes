## This article introduces:
***Transitions & Animations***

Transitions allow you to change the appearance and behavior of an element when there is a state change (hover, click, targeted, etc.)

- transition-property  
- transition-duration  
- transition-timing-function  
- transition-delay

Animations allow you to do the same as transitions in multiple key frames.

`@keyframes` rule - sets multiple points where an element should have a transition
